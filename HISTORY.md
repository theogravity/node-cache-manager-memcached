  * @lchenay: Add unit tests for `mget` `mset` `mdel` functions

# 5.0.0 (2023-07-25)
 
  * @radiorz: feat: add `mget` `mset` `mdel` function

# 4.0.0 (2021-02-10)

The library no longer depends on `memcache-plus`. A `driver` parameter is now required,
which will let you use `memcache-plus` or `memcache-pp` as the driver to use.

  * Update `standard` to the latest version.
  * Use `const/let` instead of var to comply new standard rules.
  * Use arrow funcs.
  * Add `driver` option which allow to use any compatible memcache client library.

# 3.0.0 (2021-01-28)

  * get, set, del and reset methods now returns a promise if cb hasn't been passed.
  * In some cases keys test could fail without a delay between set key and get cachedump.
  1 second delay added for get keys test.
  * Removed not in use package xtend from the deps.
  * Update dev deps: jasmine@3.6.4, cache-manager@3.4.0, standard@8.6.0.
  * Add tests for promise get, set, del and reset methods, add clean up routine with afterAll.
  * Fix getKeys: never invoke a callback if there are no items in cache.

# 2.3.0 (2021-01-04)

* Updated `memcache-plus` version to 0.2.22

# 2.2.0 (2019-10-18)

* Updated `memcache-plus` version to 0.2.20

# 2.1.0 (2016-10-27)

  * The API for sending options through was incorrect.
  * Because of the fix, the `hosts` was defaulted to the library default.
  * `hosts` must always be an array

# 2.0.0 (2016-10-24)

  * Replace `memcached` library with `memcached-plus`. 
    * There are slight changes to the API (eg the absence of an event listener) and you can only use a string as a key. 
    * The library also includes Amazon elasticache discovery support as well.
    * See [http://memcache-plus.com/](http://memcache-plus.com/) for options information

# 1.1.0 (2016-07-13)

  * Implement `keys` method. May be slow to use.

# 1.0.1 (2016-07-13)

  * Fix bug where in `set`, sending `options` as an object does not get used at all

# 1.0.0 (2016-07-11)

  * First release
